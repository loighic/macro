Sam meanwhile can only paint 1 room or mow 1 lawn per day.</p> Kate Sam paint rooms 3 1 mow lawns 6 1 Table 1 <p>Kate has an absolute advantage painting rooms and an absolute advantage mowing lawns. In one day, she can produce more mowed lawns and more painted rooms.</p> <p>Kate, however, can\u2019t do everything. Hence, we need to determine who has a comparative advantage painting rooms and who has a comparative advantage mowing lawns. To do this, we must figure out the cost\u2014that is, the opportunity cost\u2014of each person doing both jobs. Here is how we do proceed.</p> <p>If Kate paints, then she gets three rooms done in one day. Painting those three rooms, however, means that six lawns don\u2019t get mowed. Reducing this, for each room that she paints two lawns don\u2019t get mowed (3R = 6L, and so 1R = 2L). Hence, the cost of painting a room (i.e., the opportunity cost) is two mowed lawns. On the other hand, if Kate mows lawns, then she gets six lawns mowed but doesn\u2019t paint three rooms. Reducing this, each time she mows a lawn, half a room doesn\u2019t get painted (6L = 3R, and so 1L = 1/2R). Therefore, the opportunity cost of mowing one lawn is half a painted room.</p> <p>At the same time, if Sam paints, then he gets 1 room done and he doesn\u2019t mow one lawn. The opportunity cost of that one room is 1 lawn. And if Sam mows lawns, then he gets 1 lawn done and he doesn\u2019t paint one room. The opportunity cost of that 1 mowed lawn is 1 painted room.</p> Kate Sam paint 1 room 2 lawns 1 lawn mow 1 lawn \u00bd room 1 room Table 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The costs\u2014that is, the opportunity costs\u2014of having Kate and Sam do each job.  <p>Remember, an economic agent has a comparative advantage when they can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost. Opportunity costs are costs, and so, as always, we want to produce a good for the lowest possible cost (assuming that quality can be kept the same). So, who\u2014Kate or Sam\u2014can paint rooms for the lowest cost? And who can mow lawns for the lowest cost?</p> <p>Sam can paint rooms for a lower cost than can Kate. The opportunity cost of having him paint a room is only one mowed lawn, whereas it costs us two lawns when Kate does this. At the same time, Kate can mow lawns for a lower cost. The opportunity cost of having her mow a lawn is only half a painted room; it costs us one whole painted room to have Sam mow a lawn.</p> <p>So, Kate has a comparative advantage mowing lawns, and Sam has a comparative advantage painting rooms.</p> Video 1"},{"location":"pt1a/constraint/","title":"Choice and the budget constraint","text":"<p>Choices involve trade-offs, and every choice has a cost.

You might think of this as \u2018aggregate economics\u2019 since it is the study of the aggregate: the actions and decisions of all of the individual economic agents.</p> <p>Consequently, macroeconomics focuses on questions such as these: What determines how many goods and services a nation produces?

So, a marginal analysis examines the cost or benefit of consuming (or producing) an additional unit of a good. A marginal benefit is the benefit that is added by consuming (or producing) another unit. Similarly, a marginal cost is the cost that is incurred by consuming or producing an additional unit.</p> <p>For example, you might wonder what the benefit of one more hour of studying is. If it\u2019s your first or second hour of studying, then the benefit will be high. If it\u2019s your 30th hour of continuous studying, then the benefit will probably be low. Similarly, a firm producing cars might wonder what the cost is of manufacturing one more car. Again, it depends where on the spectrum this additional unit will occur.</p> <p>Utility, as it is used in economics, means something like \u201chaving one\u2019s preferences satisfied,\u201d although utility is not all or nothing. Any event\u2014eating a cookie, buying a house, going to the beach\u2014provides some number of units of utility (including zero, and perhaps negative amounts). Utility is not the same as happiness, but happiness is sometimes a good substitute when thinking about how economic decisions might affect a person\u2019s utility.</p> <p>To introduce the concept of marginal utility, let\u2019s consider a fictional example.</p> <p>Imagine that when Bill Gates started Microsoft, he had $2,000 in his personal bank account. Then, after one year, he had $5 million. After the second year, he had $10 million, after the third he had $15 million, and so on for the next nine years. Each year he added $5 million to his personal savings (except for the first, when he added $4,998,000), and so after 12 years he had $60 million. Now, consider these questions.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Just counting the happiness (or utility) that he derived from his money, which individual year do you think made him the happiest? Or otherwise stated, in which year did he achieve the greatest increase in utility?</p> </li> <li> <p>Just counting the happiness (or utility) that he derived from this money, at which point do you think he was happiest? Or otherwise stated, at which point, in these 12 years, was his utility the highest?</p> </li> </ol> <p>Assuming that Bill Gates, at least in this early part of his career, is like rest of us, we would expect that the largest increase in utility occurred in the first year, when his wealth increases from $2,000 to $5,000,000. It is good to have $2,000 in one\u2019s bank account. This amount will cover many unexpected expenses and temporary periods of unemployment. But having $5,000,000 is altogether different. This is more than enough to provide many luxuries and financial stability for a lifetime. Hence, we would expect the largest increase in Bill Gates\u2019 utility during this year.</p> <p>The next year\u2019s increase in money (from $5 million to $10 million) is slightly greater than the first year\u2019s increase. We would expect the increase in happiness (or utility), however, to be a little bit smaller. Having $10 million is, generally speaking, better than having $5 million, but it probably won\u2019t positively change a person\u2019s life as much as the change from $2,000 to $5 million would. This is not to say that getting to $10 million didn\u2019t increase Bill Gates\u2019 happiness. It just (probably) didn\u2019t increase it by as much as getting the $4,998,000 did the previous year.   </p> <p>Now, let\u2019s consider year 12. At the beginning of this year, our fictional Bill Gates had $55 million. By the end of it, he had $60 million. We would expect this additional $5 million to increase his utility (or happiness) a bit, but by less than any of the other $5 million increases. Having $60 million is, presumably, better than having $55 million, but it\u2019s not likely to change a person\u2019s well-being, happiness, or utility by much. Most of the things that you can do with $60 million, you can already do with $55 million.</p> <p></p> Figure 6  The utility that each additional $5,000,000 creates over 12 consecutive years. We typically expect that each additional unit of a good\u2014in this case each additional $5,000,000\u2014will bring a smaller amount of happiness (or utility) than the previous one. <p>Utility is subjective, and so the real Bill Gates\u2019s (or anyone else\u2019s) actual utility might be different, but generally speaking we would expect that the first $5 million would cause the largest increase in utility (or happiness), the last $5 million would cause the smallest increase, and each year in between would be lower than the previous one.</p> <p>This is not to say, however, that our fictional Bill Gates was losing utility (or happiness) each year. Figure 6 (above) shows the utility created by the additional $5 million that he acquired each year. We would expect, however, that his total utility (based just on this increasing wealth) to be increasing each year. This is illustrated in figure 7. But, as this this figure shows, marginal utility\u2014that is, the additional amount of utility created by each additional $5 million\u2014is getting smaller each year.</p> <p></p> Figure 7\u2002 Bill Gates' total utility is increasing, but each additional $5 million creates a smaller increase than the one before it. <p>The tendency for marginal utility to decrease as a person gets more and more of a good is called the law of diminishing marginal utility. As a person receives more of a good, the additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. The first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth; the first $5 million brings more satisfaction than the twelfth; and so forth.</p> <p>In the Bill Gates example, if we stretch it out many more years, we might expect that each additional $5 million that he acquires will bring at least a small increase in utility, although, perhaps, at some point, the increases will become so small that they will be negligible. In other cases, however, additional units of a good might cause unhappiness or a loss of utility, in which case more of the good will cause total utility to start falling. This would be expected, for example, if someone, even if he or she loves pizza, keeps eating slices to the point of throwing up.</p>"},{"location":"pt1a/intro2/#opportunity-cost","title":"Opportunity cost","text":"<p>The opportunity cost of a decision is the value of next best alternative. In other words, it is the value of what we give up when we make a choice. For example, maybe you went to the gym this morning. (And if you didn\u2019t, let\u2019s imagine that you did.) If you hadn\u2019t gone to the gym, what would you have been doing? Perhaps sleeping or studying or hanging out with friends. The opportunity cost of going to the gym is the best (or most valuable) of these other options. (But only the best one, not all of them.) </p> <p>Let\u2019s say that your second most preferred option would have spending an hour at a local coffee shop doing homework. So, the cost of going to the gym (i.e., the opportunity cost) is this hour spent at the coffee shop. Every choice, by definition, involves at least two options, and so every choice that we make has an opportunity cost.</p> <p>When we purchase a good or service, the opportunity cost can often be treated as the price of whatever we purchased. For instance, if you buy a new bicycle for $700, the $700 is a measure of the other things that you could have purchased, and for practical purposes, there may be no special need to identify the alternative product or products that you would have bought with that $700 if you hadn\u2019t spent it on the bicycle. </p> <p>Sometimes, however, the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true opportunity cost of a decision. This problem can loom especially large when part (or all) of the cost of an activity includes time spent doing one thing rather than another. For instance, although attending and graduating from college is, for most people, a very important and valuable activity, attending college is costly. There are the costs of tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. But in addition to those expenses, there are the alternative ways that a person could be using all of the time that he or she is devoting to college.</p>"},{"location":"pt1a/ppf/","title":"The Production possibilities frontier","text":"<p>Just as individuals cannot have everything they want and must make choices, society as a whole cannot have everything that it wants either. This section will explain the constraints society faces using a model called the production possibilities frontier (or PPF).</p> <p>Because society has limited resources (i.e., labor, land, capital, and entrepreneurship) at any point in time, there is a limit to the quantities of goods and services that it can produce. Suppose society desires two products, healthcare and education. Using all of its resources (responsibly\u2014it\u2019s not destroying the environment, using child labor, and so forth), the various combinations of these two goods that society can have are shown in figure 1.</p> <p></p> Figure 1: A healthcare and education production possibilities frontier  This production possibilities frontier shows the trade-off between devoting society's resources to healthcare and devoting them to education. (Note that by frontier we mean the line, which is at the edge\u2014or frontier\u2014of what this society can produce.) <p>In figure 1, healthcare is on the vertical axis and education is on the horizontal axis. If society allocates all of its resources to healthcare, it will achieve point A. This means, however, that it will not produce any education. Alternatively, if it allocates all of its resources to education, it will be at point F. Somewhat more sensibly, perhaps, society can also choose to produce any combination on the PPF that will give it both some healthcare and some education.</p> <p>In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society as the budget constraint plays for an individual. Society can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside the PPF. However, it does not have enough resources to produce outside (i.e., to the right of) the PPF.</p> <p>Most importantly, the production possibilities frontier shows the trade-off between healthcare and education. Suppose society is at point B, but it wants to produce more education. Because the PPF is downward sloping from left to right, the only way that it can obtain more education is by giving up some healthcare. This is the trade-off that society faces.</p> <p>Let\u2019s say that society is thinking about shifting from point B to point C. If you study figure 1, you will see that a move from B to C entails an increase in education but a loss of healthcare. (Follow point B to the vertical and horizontal axes, and then do the same for point C.) What is the opportunity cost of the education that society will gain when it shifts from B to C? The opportunity cost is the healthcare it will have to give up. Just as with Sam\u2019s budget constraint, the slope of the production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity costs of every possible choice.</p>"},{"location":"pt1a/ppf/#the-law-of-increasing-opportunity-cost","title":"The law of increasing opportunity cost","text":"<p>A budget constraint, which shows an individual\u2019s options when selecting a combination of goods, is a straight line. This is because the slope of the line is determined by the relative prices of the two goods. No matter what combination of pizzas and burritos Sam consumes in a week, one pizza will always cost as much as two burritos. Hence, his budget constraint is a straight line with a slope of -2. The production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education in figure 1 is, however, a curved line (or, more specifically, it is concave).</p> <p>To understand why the PPF is curved, we must start by making an important point: not every unit of resources (or every unit of money, let\u2019s use $1,000,000 as our units) that is spent on producing a product\u2014say, healthcare ore education\u2014yields the same benefit. The first $1,000,000 spent on healthcare, for instance, will purchase the services of the best physicians who specialize in the most critical areas of healthcare, and they can be located where they are most needed. If society devotes all its resources to healthcare, however, the last $1,000,000 will be spent workers who aren\u2019t well suited to working in healthcare and on services that aren\u2019t very important for the health of members of society.</p> <p></p> Figure 2\u00a0\u00a0A healthcare and education production possibilities frontier <p>Consider point A in figure 2. At point A, all available resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education. This situation would be extreme and even ridiculous. (Children could be checked by doctors every day but wouldn\u2019t be attending school. People could have all of the surgeries that they want, but there would be no high school or college education.) But let\u2019s say that society is at point A and then decides to shift some of its resources from healthcare to education so that it will be at point B.</p> <p>This shift won\u2019t have much effect on the quality of the healthcare that is provided or on people\u2019s health because, as just noted, when all resources (or all of the money for providing healthcare or education) are devoted to healthcare, the last several units won\u2019t (and can\u2019t) provide much benefit to society.</p> <p>But moving these resources to education, which was completely without resources at point A, can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape of the PPF between points A and B is relatively flat, representing a relatively small drop-off in healthcare and a relatively large gain in education. In other words, even though resources are being diverted away from healthcare, the amount of healthcare provided doesn\u2019t drop off that much. At the same time, a few million dollars spent on education (when there was none before) can provide a lot of education\u2014the best teachers, teaching the most important skills can now be put to work in this field.</p> <p>So, on this part of the PPF, the opportunity cost of adding education is low. Some healthcare must be given up, but not much.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the opposite of this situation exists at point F. If all resources are devoted to education, then shifting some resources to healthcare\u2014so that society is at point D\u2014won\u2019t have much effect on the amount of education provided. It will, however, yield a large increase in the amount of healthcare. The cost (i.e., the opportunity cost) of adding some healthcare when society is at point F is low. Society doesn\u2019t have to give up much education to get a large amount of healthcare.</p> <p>The situation is different if we consider points G and H, which are close to the middle of the PPF. Here, society has about equal amounts healthcare and education. And given the shape of the PPF here, if we shift resources from education to healthcare, the amount of healthcare that is gained is about equal to the amount of education that is lost (or vice versa). So, although we can\u2019t exactly read it off of the graph in figure 1, in the middle of the PPF, the cost of one unit of additional healthcare is about one unit of lost education (and vice versa).</p> <p>Of course, even if it was possible, society is not likely to choose to devote all resources to healthcare or all to education and none to the other. The lesson here, however, is that the gains from committing additional resources to education depends on how many resources have already been devoted to it (and the same for healthcare). If on the one hand, very few resources are currently committed to education, then an increase in resources used for education can bring relatively large gains at a low cost (i.e., a low opportunity cost). On the other hand, if most resources are already committed to education, then committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains and at a high cost.</p> <p>This pattern reflects the law of increasing opportunity cost: as the production of a good or service increases, the marginal opportunity cost of producing it (i.e., the cost of producing an additional unit) increases as well. This happens because some resources are better suited for producing certain goods and services instead of others, which in turn, is why the PPF has the shape that it does.</p> Video 1"},{"location":"pt1a/ppf/#productive-and-allocative-efficiency","title":"Productive and allocative efficiency","text":"<p>In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice of a point on a production possibilities frontier will involve a mixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government.

The economic meaning is similar. In different contexts, it can be used in slightly different ways, but often it refers to a state where it is impossible to make one party (person, firm, country) better off without making another party worse off.

This will provide it with more of some or all goods.</p> <p>Second, when resources grow over a period of years (e.g., the amount of labor and capital increases), the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to shift outward and society will be able to have more of all goods.</p> <p>Both of these, however, take time to discover and implement, and so the increases to production happen only gradually. Thus, in the present, a society must make tradeoffs. For government, this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm. At the individual and firm level, the market economy coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that people want.

Many of the national economies that have shown the most rapid growth in the last fifty years\u2014for example, Japan, South Korea, China, and India\u2014have done so by dramatically orienting their economies toward international trade. There is no modern example of a country that has shut itself off from world trade and yet prospered. To understand the benefits of trade, or why we trade in the first place, we need to understand the concepts of comparative and absolute advantage.</p> <p>In 1817, David Ricardo, a businessman, economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a treatise called On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. In this treatise, Ricardo argued that specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners, even those that may be relatively inefficient.

Absolute advantage can be the result of a country\u2019s natural endowment. For example, extracting oil in Saudi Arabia is pretty much just a matter of drilling a hole somewhere. Producing oil in other countries can require considerable exploration and costly technologies for drilling and extraction\u2014if they have any oil at all.

Guatemala and Colombia have climates especially suited for growing coffee. Chile and Zambia have some of the world\u2019s richest copper mines.

Alternatively, if it produces only corn, it can produce 25 bushels of corn and zero barrels of oil (point B). It can also produce other combinations of oil and corn if it wants to consume both goods, such as at point C. Here, it produces (and consumes) 60 barrels of oil, leaving 40 labor hours that are spent on the production of 10 bushels of corn.</p> <p>If the United States produces only oil, it can produce, at most, 50 barrels. This is point A\u2032. At the other extreme, it can produce 100 bushels of corn and no oil (point B\u2032).

Thus, before trade, the Saudi Arabian economy will devote 60 labor hours to producing oil, which will yield 60 barrels of oil (in bold on the left side of table 2). With the remaining 40 labor hour (since it needs four hours to produce a bushel of corn), it can produce only 10 bushels.

It can produce corn for a lower cost: .50 vs 4 barrels of oil.  <p>We defined comparative advantage in terms of the opportunity cost of producing goods. A country has a comparative advantage in the production of a good when it can produce the good at a lower cost (that is, a lower opportunity cost). </p> <p>Look at table 3. Which country can produce 1 barrel of oil at a lower opportunity cost? Saudi Arabia. When it produces a barrel of oil, it only gives up \u00bc bushel of corn, while the United States gives up 2 bushels of corn.

This is a much lower opportunity cost than Saudi Arabia\u2019s. Saudi Arabia gives up 4 barrels of oil to produce a bushel of corn. So, the United States has a comparative advantage in corn production.</p> <p>In this example, there is a symmetry between absolute and comparative advantage. Saudi Arabia can produce more oil with its 100 labor hours, and so it has an absolute advantage in oil production. It also gives up the least in terms of corn production to produce oil, and so it has a comparative advantage in oil production. </p> <p>At the same time, the United States has an absolute and a comparative advantage in corn production. Such symmetry is not always the case. Sometimes a country can have an absolute advantage in the production of both goods. It won\u2019t, however, have a comparative advantage for both.

So, the nominal price of a dozen eggs was $0.84 in 1980 and $2.80 in 2023. The real value, on the other hand, is a price that has been adjusted for inflation.

One way to think about it is that nominal, which comes from the Latin word for name, is the label that we put on a good or service. It\u2019s the price that you see when you go to the store. In contrast, the real price is the one that you won\u2019t see in the store, but it\u2019s the true (or real) value of the good or service.

Thus, a recession lasts from peak to trough, and an economic expansion runs from trough to peak.</p> <p></p> Figure 4\u2002 The business cycle is the interval from one peak to the next peak. Image from the Reserve Bank of Australia. <p>The whole cycle from one peak to the next peak (with a trough between the two) is the business cycle. It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough-to-peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened since 1960. The most recent recession was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This recession started in February 2020 and officially ended in May 2020. This was the most severe recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s, but also the shortest. The previous recession, the Great Recession, was also very severe, and it lasted about 18 months. The expansion that began in June 2009 (at the trough of the Great Recession), however, was the longest on record\u2014lasting 128 months until the pandemic-induced recession began.</p>"},{"location":"pt2/gdp_2b/#why-is-gdp-important","title":"Why is GDP important?","text":"<p>In a moment, we will turn to some of the limitations of GDP, but first, let\u2019s examine why this figure is so important.

At the same time, other companies are thriving and expanding. In a perfect world, all of the people who were laid off would immediately find new jobs with the companies that need more workers. In the real world, however, even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies, it takes time for unemployed workers to find out about new jobs, interview and figure out if a particular job will be a good match, and then, in some cases, move to a different part of the state or country.</p> <p>In 2019, for example, there were typically about 6 million unemployed people at any given time in the U.S. Even though about two-thirds of those unemployed people found a job in 14 or fewer weeks, the unemployment rate did not change much during the year because those who found new jobs were largely offset by others who lost jobs.</p> <p>The unemployment that occurs because workers are move between jobs is called frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing. It takes time to match the people who are looking for employment with the best job for each of them\u2014or, at least, with a job that is a reasonably good match for each of them. For individuals and companies to be successful and productive, people should find the job for which they are best suited, and not just take the first job offered to them because it was the first.</p> <p>Also included in frictional unemployment are recent college graduates who have just entered the labor market and are looking for a job.

In other cases, the unemployed workers never acquired many (or any) skills in the first place\u2014as is generally the case with high school dropouts. Unemployment that is caused by a mismatch between the skills that workers have and the skills that are needed is called structural unemployment.</p> <p>Structural unemployment does have a high cost. Many of the people who are unemployed for structural reasons will have difficulty finding new jobs\u2014even if they are given the opportunity to acquire new skills. But as with frictional unemployment, it is part of a healthy and dynamic economy. Ultimately, it is best for society to have the people with the most in-demand skills working. Education seems to be the key in minimizing the amount of structural unemployment. Individuals who have more years of education are (a) more likely to have the skills that are needed for current jobs and (b) have an easier time acquiring new skills if the need arises.</p> <p>So, to answer our original question on this page, an unemployment rate of zero would not be ideal because it would mean rushing people into jobs for which they may not be ideally suited and employing workers who lack the skills to be as productive as we would like.

According to the supply-and-demand model, cyclical unemployment is avoidable, and the fact that it is relatively common presents something of a puzzle.</p> <p>To understand this puzzle, let\u2019s think about the supply and demand for labor (figure 4). Supply in this case refers to the supply of labor, and so the \u201csuppliers\u201d are workers. The demand for labor, on the other hand, comes from firms. Price is the price of labor\u2014that is, wages\u2014and the point where supply and demand intersect gives us the equilibrium price (i.e., the equilibrium wage) and the equilibrium quantity.</p> <p></p> Figure 4: Supply and demand for labor\u00a0\u00a0In a labor market with flexible wages, the equilibrium will occur at wage We and quantity Qe. At this point, the number of people who want jobs equals the number of jobs available. <p>When firms are expanding and need to hire more workers, then the demand for labor increases. (See figure 5.) Supply may increase in this scenario if people who weren\u2019t previously in the labor force enter the labor force, but let\u2019s assume that supply doesn\u2019t change. Since the demand curve shifts to the right, the equilibrium wage and equilibrium quantity both increase. And this is generally what happens in the real world.</p> <p></p> Figure 5\u2002 When demand for labor increases, the equilibrium wage increases from W<sub>0</sub> to W<sub>1</sub> and the equilibrium quantity increases from Q<sub>0</sub> to Q<sub>1</sub>. <p>When firms are contracting instead of expanding, however, they will slow hiring or lay off some of their workers. This is a decrease in demand, and the demand curve will shift to the left. This is shown in figure 6. Since we now have a new equilibrium, according to the supply-and-demand model, the prevailing wage should fall from W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>. But what we often see is that the wage remains unchanged. Just as with supply and demand for any good or service, this creates a surplus\u2014in this case, a surplus of labor, which is unemployment.</p> <p></p> Figure 6\u2002 If the demand for labor decreases but the wage remains at W<sub>1</sub>, then there will be a surplus of labor (i.e., unemployment). <p>It is possible that people who are unemployed are not willing to work at the current equilibrium wage, say $15 an hour, but would be willing to work at a higher wage, like $20 per hour. The monthly Current Population Survey would count these people as unemployed because they say they are ready and looking for work (at $20 per hour). However, from an economist\u2019s perspective, these people are choosing to be unemployed.</p> <p>Probably a few people are unemployed because of unrealistic expectations about wages, but they do not represent the majority of the unemployed. Instead, unemployed people often have friends or acquaintances of similar skill levels who are employed, and the unemployed would be willing to work at jobs and wages similar to what those people are receiving. However, the employers of their friends and acquaintances do not seem to be hiring. In other words, these people are involuntarily unemployed.

At the same time, employers know that it is costly and time-consuming to hire and train new employees, so they would prefer to pay workers a little extra now rather than lose them and have to hire and train new workers.

First, let\u2019s review how exchange rates work.</p> <p>When you exchange U.S. dollars for a foreign currency, you are, in effect, buying the other currency. The U.S. dollar is stronger when $1 buys more of the foreign currency. The U.S. dollar is weaker when $1 buys less of the foreign currency. Stronger and weaker, in this sense, is with respect to one other currency and the historical trends.  </p> <p>For instance, as you can see here, in October 2022, 1 U.S. dollar bought slightly more than 1 Euro. At the beginning of 2024, meanwhile, 1 U.S. dollar bought a little over 0.90 Euro. So, relative to January 2024, the U.S. dollar was stronger in October of 2022. Conversely, in 2024, the U.S. dollar has been weaker relative to October 2022.</p> <p>Now, how does this affect imports and exports?</p> <p>A strong dollar causes exports to decrease and imports to increase.</p> <p>A weak dollar causes exports to increase and imports to decrease.</p> <p>The central idea is as follows. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Let\u2019s say that, initially, 1 U.S. dollar (1 USD) buys 1 Euro (1 EUR).

The U.S. dollar has gotten stronger. Now, with 1 USD (or however much we have), we can buy more stuff produced in Europe. Hence, imports from Europe will increase. At the same time, with this exchange rate, 1 EUR buys only 0.80 USD (i.e., $0.80). Now, with 1 EUR (or however much they have), Europeans will be able to buy less of our stuff. This means that exports to Europe will decrease.</p> </li> <li> <p>The exchange rate changes again. Now, 1 USD buys only 0.75 EUR. The U.S. dollar has gotten weaker. With 1 USD (or however much we have), we can buy less stuff produced in Europe. Consequently, imports from Europe will decrease. At the same time, with this exchange rate, 1 EUR buys 1.33 USD. Now, with 1 EUR (or however much they have), Europeans will be able to buy more of our stuff. This means that exports to Europe will increase.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Since a stronger dollar (relative to other major currencies) causes export to decrease and imports to increase, a stronger dollar will cause aggregate demand to decrease, shifting the AD curve to the left.</p> <p>On the other hand, since a weaker dollar (relative to other major currencies) causes exports to increase and imports to decrease, a weaker dollar will cause aggregate demand to increase, shifting the curve to the right.</p>"},{"location":"pt3a/AD-AS_shifts/#factors-that-shift-short-run-aggregate-supply-curve","title":"Factors that shift short-run aggregate supply curve","text":""},{"location":"pt3a/AD-AS_shifts/#productivity-growth","title":"Productivity growth","text":"<p>Productivity growth will increase both long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) and short-run aggregate supply.

This includes the costs associated with changing price tags, websites, printed materials, and any other places where the (nominal) price has already been given. Menu costs also include the costs incurred by confusing or angering customers, and the cost of determining what the new price should be.</p> <p>So, the picture that this theory gives us is one where enough firms are changing their prices so that the price level itself changes. But because of menu costs, some firms aren\u2019t able to adjust their prices.</p> <p>Here are the two scenarios:</p> <p>The price level decreases, but, because of menu costs or existing contracts, some firms don\u2019t adjust their prices downward. Consequently, because their prices are too high, their sales decline. These firms, then, reduce employment and output.</p> <p>The price level increases, but, because of menu costs or existing contracts, some firms don\u2019t raise their prices. Their sales increase, and so they increase investment and hire more workers, which increases output.</p>"},{"location":"pt3a/AS/#the-misperceptions-theory","title":"The misperceptions theory","text":"<p>Third is the misperceptions theory. This theory doesn\u2019t include the idea that prices or wages are sticky. Instead, as the name suggests, there is a misperception about what is occurring when the price level changes. If a perfectly informed person understood that all prices (including wages) were changing, then this person would have no reason to change his or her behavior in response to a change to the price level. </p> <p>But, according to this theory, when the price level changes, people misinterpret the change to the price that they watch the most closely. Producers and workers see that certain prices are changing, and they misinterpret these changes as being changes to either (1) only the goods or services that they produce or (2) only their own wages. Not realizing that all (or most) prices are rising or falling, they change their behavior. We will just focus on the producers\u2019 misperception.</p> <p>Let\u2019s say that the price level is decreasing. A type of producer\u2014say, wheat farmers\u2014watches the price of wheat closely, and they see that this price has fallen. At the same time, they don\u2019t immediately notice that the prices of the inputs that they use have also fallen. Believing that they still have high costs while they are getting a low price for their wheat, they reduce employment and other costs. Consequently, they produce less wheat (and the same happens for many other kinds of producers), and GDP falls.</p> <p>When the price level is increasing, producers\u2014in our example wheat farmers\u2014see that the price at which they can sell wheat has increased. They don\u2019t, however, immediately notice that the prices of their labor and other inputs have also increased. So, they produce more wheat (and the same happens for many other kinds of producers), and GDP increases.</p> <p>Remember that these three theories seek to explain why the SRAS curve is positively sloped. As such, each explains why a change to the price level causes actual output to move to a different point on the SRAS curve (while the curve itself stays in the same place). Later, we will examine the factors, other than price level, that affect SRAS.

This would continue for 40 years, at which point, the person would get his or her $100 back.

You get your $1.50 every six months, but after 10 years, you need some money. So, you decide to sell the bond on the secondary bond market. The person who buys this bond will get the payments every six months, and he or she will also get your $100 back in December 2021.

Not $190 because then this person would just, eventually, get back exactly what he or she paid for it. The idea is to pay less than this amount and make some money from the purchase.</p> <p>How much someone pays depends on the other investment opportunities that are available and how safe an Mississippi State University bond is believed to be in 1991. (One risk of buying any bond is that the issuer might not be able to continue making interest payments or pay back the value of the bond. In other words, the issuer might default.)

How would people exchange goods and services? Economies without money typically engage in the barter system. Barter is (literally) trading one good or service for another good or service, and it is highly inefficient.</p> <p>In an economy without money, an exchange between two people must involve a double coincidence of wants, a situation in which two people each want the good or service that the other person can provide. For example, if a farmer who has excess vegetables needs a pair of shoes, this farmer must find someone who makes (or at least has) shoes and who also wants vegetables. Under the best circumstances, such a trade would take some work to arrange, and in a modern economy, it would be next to impossible.</p> <p>Another problem with the barter system is that it does not allow people who have perishable goods to hold onto them and trade them in the future.

First, money is an intermediary between a buyer and a seller. Instead of exchanging vegetables for shoes, the farmer can now exchange vegetables for money. He or she can then use this money to buy shoes or anything else. Performing this function makes money a medium of exchange.</p> <p>Second, money is a store of value. In a barter system, someone who makes shoes could, conceivably, store some of the shoes as a means of accumulating savings. To do this, however, the shoemaker must incur the cost of a storage facility and make sure that the shoes do not get damaged. Even if the shoes are safely stored, the shoemaker has to hope that the shoes do not go out of style in six months or a year. And while this might, in some manner, work for shoes, it is impossible for perishable goods that won\u2019t even last for weeks or months.</p> <p>So, shoes could be a store of value, but they aren\u2019t a very good one. Holding money is a much easier way of storing value. Money doesn\u2019t need to be spent immediately because it will still have the same value (or close to it) the next day, week, month, or the next year.</p> <p>Money performs this function, even though it is not a perfect store of value. In an economy with inflation, money loses some value each year. But it still remains a very efficient store of value, especially over periods of weeks or months.</p> <p>Third, money is a unit of account. As such, it is the ruler by which we measure the value of all goods and services. For instance, when you go to a grocery store, it might take you some time to determine which goods you want to purchase and in which quantities. But it will take you no time at all to determine and compare the value of the tomatoes, the salmon, the flour, the potatoes, the coffee, and so on. This is because the value of each is expressed in U.S. dollars.</p> <p>Anything that performs these three functions is money, and many things have been used as money throughout history: gold, silver, cowrie shells, cigarettes, cocoa beans, and many others including, of course, pieces of paper.</p>"},{"location":"pt3b/money_1/#commodity-backed-versus-fiat-money","title":"Commodity-backed versus fiat money","text":"<p>Gold and silver in the form of coins or bars are examples of commodity money.
