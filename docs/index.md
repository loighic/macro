# A Short & Online Principles of Macroeconomics


!!! question "Site migration"

    This site is currently (and maybe fore a while) being moved from [here](https://loighic.net/macrox/). So, not every page is complete. Most of the paths for the images need to be fixed and there is other formatting that needs to be changed.


This online textbook has three parts. Part 1 covers some introductory concepts, the production possibilities frontier, comparative advantage, trade, and then supply and demand. Part 2 covers gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation. And in part 3, we examine the aggregate demand - aggreate supply model, fiscal policy, money, and monetary policy. 


!!! warning "Use light mode"

    Currently, this website is only designed to work in light mode. It will function in dark mode, but some of the features---especially tables and captions---do not have dark mode formatting, and so can only be viewed in light mode.
	
	If you find yourself in dark mode, you can get to light mode by selecting the icon next to the search field.
