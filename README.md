SOPMacro contains only what I use when teaching this course. Some content is taken from the [OpenStax Principles of Macroeconomics](https://openstax.org/details/books/principles-macroeconomics-3e), but most of it is a write up of my notes (plus figures, tables, and short videos). The emphasis in my course&mdash;which is, perhaps, reflected in the textbook&mdash;is on problem solving. (E.g., if the Fed buys $500 worth of treasury bonds from a bank, how and by how much will that affect loans.) Consequently, there is less emphasis on learning the breadth of terms and ideas that are covered in the published textbooks. Sorry, *durable goods*, if any of my students want to know what you are, they'll have to look it up themselves.

Other instructors are welcome to use all or any part of it, and it can easily be modified to reflect other instructor's goals and content for the course. 

Since the files are written in markdown, there are several ways to create your own site. I am using [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), and so doing the same is probably the easiest option. You can fork this repository and then follow this [video](https://youtu.be/Q-YA_dA8C20) to begin using Mkdocs. 


### Some notes about setting up Mkdocs

When installing Python check the "Add Python 3.8 to PATH." See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13596505/python-command-not-working-in-command-prompt) for more explanation and a screen shot. 

If you are using Windows, run ```venv\Scripts\activate``` after ```python -m venv venv```.
